HackFridays: Mobile React 101 package starter
==================================
A simple starter kit for HackFridays: Mobile React 101 package.


## Installation

1.  Please make sure to carefully follow all the instructions on React Native's official documentation depending on your development operating system:
    * [Getting Started with React-Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content)

2.  Clone the starter kit: `https://github.com/Cloudoki/react-native-boilerplate.git`

3.  Install project dependencies:
    `npm install`

## Testing your React Native Installation

After following the React Native's tutorial and installing all the project dependencies, you should be able to run and test your mobile application.

### Run React Native Packager

The [React Native Packager](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/packager) is similar to Webpack, providing a CommonJS-like module system, JavaScript compilation (ES6, Flow, JSX), bundling, and asset loading.
```
react-native start
```

### Running the App

#### For Android:

1.  In Android Studio, open the project located in the `android` folder.
2.  Go to Tools -> Android -> AVD Manager
3.  Create a Virtual Device (See the example below)

4.  Run your Virtual Device
5.  Finally run the app with `react-native run-android`

#### For iOS:

The process for running your app in iOS is more straightforward. Just run `react-native run-ios` command and you should see your app running in the iOS Simulator shortly. You can also run it directly from within Xcode by opening the project located in `ios/Hackfridays.xcodeproj`.

**Note:** If you want to test your app on an actual device, follow the instructions [Running on Device](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html).
